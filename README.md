# udemy-webcomponents-course CI sample
This contains the sample setup of Continuous Integration via Circle CI for [Udemy course on webcomponents with lit-html & redux](https://www.udemy.com/webcomponents-apps). 

**At the end of the testing chapter you'll end up with:**

- Linting & prettier setup
- Unit tests & integration tests written via karma
- Automatic tests running on Circle CI
- Slack notifications for failing and fixed tests
- Status badges on your repo

You are free to follow this course without buying the course on Udemy, each folder contains a readme with instructions. However, I appreciate the support, you can buy the course [at a discounted price of $9.99 via this promo link](https://www.udemy.com/webcomponents-apps/?couponCode=GITHUB2). Buying this course helps me support myself and enables me to add additional chapters to it.
